    <h2>Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Thanks to CSS3, we can include great transitions and animations without using another programming language.</li>
      <li>-	Transforms can translate, rotate, and scale our HTML elements. We can use the property transform to define it.</li>
      <li>-	Translate moves our element in the x and y-axis. We can include a percentage or other measure units as well as positive or negative values.</li>
      <li>-	Rotate can be used on the three axes. It uses the unit deg to define the amount of rotation. It also supports positive and negative values.</li>
      <li>-	The scale uses numbers to define the amount of size increment or decrement. It can also be applied to one axis and accepts positive and negative values.</li>
      <li>-	The order in which transforms is defined matters since if we rotate the object, its axis is also rotated. New transformations will be applied considering the new axis position. </li>
      <li>-	We can change the center or origin of the transform by using the property transform-origin. The transforms will be applied to this new origin. It mainly affects rotation and skew.</li>
      <li>-	Transition helps us create a smooth change between states of the HTML elements. </li>
      <li>-	Transition is based on interpolation and can be used in properties that have initial and end values that can be interpolated.</li>
      <li>-	A transition can be applied to all or just some of the properties. </li>
      <li>-	We can define the duration of the transition using transition-duration. Good transitions last 200ms approximately</li>
      <li>-	We can define a different interpolation of the values with a transition-timing-function. When we do that, some parts of the transition can last a little bit or a little less. However, the whole transition lasts the same. </li>
      <li>-	Our transition can have a delay before it starts by using the transition-delay property.</li>
      <li>-	Animations also use interpolation, but we can define the properties that will be applied to the HTML elements at certain points of the animation.</li>
      <li>-	Animations can run an infinite time.</li>
      <li>-	We define an animation by using a keyframe and defining the progress of the animation.</li>
      <li>-	The transforms property can be used inside animations.</li>
      <li>-	We can animation-timing-function and it makes the same that transition-timing-function.</li>
    </ul>
